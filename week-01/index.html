    <h1>Welcome to my Week 1 webpage!</h1>
    <p>This week I learned to use Emmet Abbreviations to easily write html code and use tags to create this paragraph.</p>
    <p>Many types of HTML elements can be found on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements" target="_blank">Mozilla Developer Resources Page</a> and I hope to use a lot of them.</p>
    <p>We also learned how to update our code with images, image attributes like text descriptions, and commit them to our GitHub repositories.</p>
